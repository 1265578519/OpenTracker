.SH NAME
io_timeouted \- return a file descriptor over deadline
.SH SYNTAX
.B #include <libowfat/io.h>

int64 \fBio_timeouted\fP();
.SH DESCRIPTION
io_timeouted returns the next file descriptor that is past it's deadline.
If no descriptors are past their deadlines, it returns -1.

After io_timeouted() returned -1, you should wait a second before
calling it again.  Checking for connections past their deadline involves
walking through the whole data structure, which may thrash the CPU
cache needlessly.  Treat it as an expensive operation.
