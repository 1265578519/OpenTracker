tai_now \- get current time
.SH SYNTAX
.B #include <libowfat/tai.h>

extern int \fBtai_now\fP(struct tai* \fIt\fR);
.SH DESCRIPTION
tai_now puts the current time into \fIt\fR. More precisely: tai_now puts into
\fIt\fR its best guess as to the TAI64 label for the 1-second interval that
contains the current time.

This implementation of tai_now assumes that the time_t returned from the
time function represents the number of TAI seconds since 1970-01-01
00:00:10 TAI. This matches the convention used by the Olson tz library
in ``right'' mode.
