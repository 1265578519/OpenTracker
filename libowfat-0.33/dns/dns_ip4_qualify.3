.SH NAME
dns_ip4_qualify \- qualify name and look up IPv4 addresses
.SH SYNTAX
.B #include <libowfat/dns.h>

int \fBdns_ip4_qualify\fP(stralloc* \fIout\fR,stralloc* \fIfqdn\fR,
                    const stralloc* \fIudn\fR);
.SH DESCRIPTION
dns_ip4_qualify feeds the name \fIudn\fR through qualification and looks up
4-byte IP addresses for the result. It puts the fully qualified domain name
into \fIfqdn\fR, puts the concatenation of the IP addresses into \fIout\fR, and
returns 0. If the domain does not exist in DNS, or has no IP addresses,
\fIout\fR will be empty.

If dns_ip4_qualify has trouble with the qualification, has trouble with DNS, or
runs out of memory, it returns -1, setting errno appropriately. It may or may
not change \fIout\fR and \fIfqdn\fR.
