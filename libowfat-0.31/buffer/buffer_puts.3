.TH buffer_puts 3
.SH NAME
buffer_puts \- write ASCIIZ string to buffer
.SH SYNTAX
.B #include <buffer.h>

int \fBbuffer_puts\fP(buffer* \fIb\fR,const char* \fIx\fR);
.SH DESCRIPTION
buffer_puts is like buffer_put with \fIlen\fR determined as the number
of bytes before the first \\0 in \fIx\fR.

The difference to buffer_putsalign is that, when there isn't enough space
for new data, buffer_puts calls buffer_flush before copying any data,
while buffer_putsalign fills all available space with data before calling
buffer_flush.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
buffer_puts returns 0 if everything was fine, -1 on error (setting
errno).
.SH "SEE ALSO"
buffer_putsalign(3), buffer_put(3), buffer_flush(3), buffer(3)
