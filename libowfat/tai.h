/* A struct tai value is an integer between 0 inclusive and 2^64

 * operations; applications should not look inside struct tai.

 * A struct tai variable is commonly used to store a TAI64 label. Each
 * TAI64 label refers to one second of real time. TAI64 labels span a
 * range of hundreds of billions of years.
 *
 * A struct tai variable may also be used to store the numerical
 * difference between two TAI64 labels.
