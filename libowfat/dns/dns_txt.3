int \fBdns_txt\fP(stralloc* \fIout\fR,stralloc* \fIfqdn\fR);
.SH DESCRIPTION
dns_txt looks up TXT records for the fully-qualified domain name in
\fIfqdn\fR. It puts the concatenation of the TXT records into \fIout\fR
and returns 0.  If the domain does not exist in DNS, or has no TXT
records, \fIout\fR will be empty.

If dns_txt has trouble with the DNS lookup or runs out of memory, it returns
-1, setting errno appropriately. It may or may not change \fIout\fR.
