.SH NAME
uint32_unpack \- read an unsigned little-endian 32-bit integer
.SH SYNTAX

uint32 \fIu\fR;

void \fBuint32_unpack\fP(const char \fIs\fR[4],uint32 *\fIu\fR);
.SH DESCRIPTION
uint32 is a 32-bit unsigned integer type, normally either unsigned int
or unsigned long.

uint32_unpack portably reads a uint32 as stored on a little-endian
architecture from \fIs\fR and writes it into \fIu\fR in the native byte order.
