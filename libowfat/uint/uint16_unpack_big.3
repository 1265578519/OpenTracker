.SH NAME
uint16_unpack_big \- read an unsigned big-endian 16-bit integer
.SH SYNTAX
.B #include <libowfat/uint16.h>

uint16 \fIu\fR;

void \fBuint16_unpack_big\fP(const char \fIs\fR[2],uint16 *\fIu\fR);
.SH DESCRIPTION
uint16 is a 16-bit unsigned integer type, normally either unsigned int
or unsigned long.

uint16_unpack_big portably reads a uint16 as stored on a big-endian
architecture (i.e. in network byte order) from \fIs\fR and writes it
into \fIu\fR in the native byte order.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
uint16_pack_big(3), uint16_unpack(3)
