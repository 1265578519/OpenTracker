.SH NAME
uint16_unpack \- read an unsigned little-endian 16-bit integer
.SH SYNTAX

uint16 \fIu\fR;

void \fBuint16_unpack\fP(const char \fIs\fR[2],uint16 *\fIu\fR);
.SH DESCRIPTION
uint16 is a 16-bit unsigned integer type, normally either unsigned int
or unsigned long.

uint16_unpack portably reads a uint16 as stored on a little-endian
architecture from \fIs\fR and writes it into \fIu\fR in the native byte order.
