/* We simulate a level-triggered API on top of an event signalling
 * mechanism that can be level-triggered (epoll/kqueue/poll) or
 * edge-triggered (SIGIO).
 * Difficulty: we want to avoid unnecessary syscalls, so we keep state
 * internally.  If the user says he does not want to read/write anymore,
 * we don't tell the kernel straight away.  The rationale is that the
 * typical protocol consists of interleaved reading and writing, so
 * after each read you'd call io_dontwantread, io_wantwrite, io_wait,
 * io_dontwantwrite, io_wantread, and in the regular case there is no
 * incoming data between io_dontwantread and io_wantread, so we might as
 * well optimistically not do those syscalls and then handle the
 * complexity if there is more incoming data. */
