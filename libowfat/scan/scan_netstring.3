.SH NAME
scan_netstring \- parse a netstring
.SH SYNTAX
.B #include <libowfat/scan.h>

size_t \fBscan_netstring\fP(const char *\fIin\fR,size_t len,char** \fIdest\fR, size_t *\fIslen\fR);
.SH DESCRIPTION
scan_netstring attempts to parse the netstring in the input buffer
(in,len). If the buffer contains a valid netstring, then (*dest,*slen)
is set to the start and length of the transported string.

Note that this string is not zero terminated. No copy is made.
scan_netstring points it inside the input buffer.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
scan_netstring returns the number of bytes in the netstring (the outer
representation, not the transported inner string) if parsing worked, or
0 if the input buffer did not contain a valid (or full) netstring.

.SH EXAMPLE
The raw memory buffer "foo" would become the netstring "3:foo,"
