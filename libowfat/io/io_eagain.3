.TH io_eagain 3
.SH NAME
io_eagain \- tell io_wait that you got an EAGAIN
.SH SYNTAX
.B #include <libowfat/io.h>

void \fBio_eagain\fP(int64 fd);
.SH DESCRIPTION
If io_wait() said that you can read from a descriptor, you try to read
from it, and you get EAGAIN, you need to tell io_wait().  This is
important for edge triggered event notification schemes like Linux 2.4's
SIGIO, or you will lose events.

io_tryread(), io_trywrite() and io_sendfile() and iob_send() already
take care of this for you.

This function is only of interest if you integrate io_wait() with legacy
code that uses read/write directly.
