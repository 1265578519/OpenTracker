.TH io_dontwantread 3
.SH NAME
io_dontwantread \- signal that you do not want to read from a descriptor
.SH SYNTAX
.B #include <libowfat/io.h>

void \fBio_dontwantread\fP(int64 fd);
.SH DESCRIPTION
io_dontwantread tells the next io_wait() that you don't want to read
from this descriptor for now.  Call io_wantread() again if you change
your mind.

You have to have called io_fd on the descriptor first (io_pipe and
io_socketpair do this for you).  Waiting on descriptors only works for
sockets, fifos and pipes.  It may also work on devices and TTYs, but
that is platform dependent -- you should not rely on that.
