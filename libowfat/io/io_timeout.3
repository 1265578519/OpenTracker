.TH io_timeout 3
.SH NAME
io_timeout \- set time limit on descriptor
.SH SYNTAX
.B #include <libowfat/io.h>

void \fBio_timeout\fP(int64 fd,tai6464 deadline);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The io library keeps track of an optional ``timeout'' for each descriptor. The
timeout is a specific moment in time, stored in a tai6464 variable.

io_timeout(\fId\fR,\fIt\fR) sets the timeout for descriptor \fId\fR to \fIt\fR.

io_timeout has no return value; it always succeeds. (Space to store the timeout
was already allocated as part of the descriptor.) It has no effect if \fId\fR is not
the number of a descriptor.

Note that you have to call io_timeouted to be notified of timeouts, just
like you are calling io_canread or io_canwrite for read and write
notification.
