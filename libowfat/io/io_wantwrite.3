.TH io_wantwrite 3
.SH NAME
io_wantwrite \- signal that you want to write to a descriptor
.SH SYNTAX
.B #include <libowfat/io.h>

void \fBio_wantwrite\fP(int64 fd);
.SH DESCRIPTION
io_wantwrite tells the next io_wait() that you want to write to this
descriptor.  Call io_dontwantwrite() again if you change your mind.

The next time you call io_wait(), it will look whether this descriptor
becomes writeable, too.  You can then use io_canwrite() to check whether
the descriptor has become writable.

You have to have called io_fd on the descriptor first (io_pipe and
io_socketpair do this for you).  Waiting on descriptors only works for
sockets, fifos and pipes.  It may also work on devices and TTYs, but
that is platform dependent -- you should not rely on that.
