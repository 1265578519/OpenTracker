/* This header defines an indirect array for use with the io_* routines.
 * Assumptions:
 * - the elements are small (many fit on one page),
 * - the platform has an atomic compare-and-swap instruction
 * - the compiler supports it via __sync_val_compare_and_swap

/* The basic data structure is a static array of pointers to pages.
 * Each page also contains a next pointer to form a linked list.
 * To get to element n, you take n % the number of elements in the
 * static array (iarray->pages) to get to the list of pages that
 * contains it. Then keep going to the next page until you are on the
 * right page.
 * Note: The elements on each page are not contiguous. If the fanout is
 * 16, the indices on page 0 are 0, 16, 32, ...
 * To get to element 0, you'd go to iarray->pages[0].data,
 * to get to element 1, you'd go to iarray->pages[1].data,
 * to get to element 16, you'd go to iarray->pages[0].data+iarray->elemsize.
